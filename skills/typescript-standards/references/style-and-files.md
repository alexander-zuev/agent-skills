# Style and files

## TypeScript style and safety

Use strict TypeScript settings where practical:

- `strict: true`
- `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`
- `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`
- `noImplicitOverride: true`
- `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch: true`

Target ES2025 or newer: set `target` and `lib` to `ES2025` at least. Never lower them for old runtimes.
Use the built-in APIs this enables, such as `Map.groupBy`, iterator helpers, and `Set` methods, before writing loops by hand.

Prefer immutable values:

```ts
type CreateUserInput = {
  readonly email: EmailAddress;
  readonly roles: ReadonlyArray<Role>;
};
```

Mutation is acceptable inside localized imperative shell code, performance-sensitive internals, builders, or adapters when hidden behind a precise interface.

### Casts, `any`, and non-null assertions

Avoid:

- `any`
- non-null assertions (the postfix exclamation mark)
- casts with `as Type`

`as const` is fine.

Rare exceptions are allowed for highly generic helpers, branding internals, interop boundaries, or combinators where TypeScript cannot express the invariant.

Any non-`as const` cast requires a Rust-like safety comment:

```ts
// SAFETY: TypeScript cannot express the brand. parseEmailAddress checked the normalized string before branding. Callers cannot construct EmailAddress except through this parser.
return normalized as EmailAddress;
```

Rare `any` also requires a targeted oxlint ignore and justification:

```ts
// oxlint-disable-next-line no-explicit-any -- SAFETY: This helper preserves arbitrary function parameters; TypeScript cannot express this variadic constraint without any.
type Fn = (...args: any[]) => unknown;
```

Do not use non-null assertions. Branch, parse, or refine instead.

## Imports, exports, and files

Name modules by purpose or responsibility. Include technology only when that technology defines the boundary.
Use kebab-case for JavaScript/TypeScript files, including components. Use snake_case for Python files.

Prefer direct imports from the file that owns the abstraction. Avoid barrel files / `index.ts` re-export layers by default.

For domain modules, namespace imports often preserve the module shape:

```ts
import * as EmailAddress from "./email-address";

EmailAddress.parse(input);
```

Use named imports for classes and focused shared helpers:

```ts
import { PasswordReset } from "./password-reset";
```

Use `import type` / `export type` for type-only imports and exports.

Export only what callers should use. Keep internal helpers unexported unless intentionally shared. Do not export internals just for tests.

Avoid TypeScript `namespace` unless there is a compelling interop reason.

Avoid vague files:

```txt
utils.ts
helpers.ts
common.ts
misc.ts
```

Use precise names:

```txt
email-address.ts
billing-period.ts
string-case.ts
array.ts
```

Tiny ubiquitous generic helpers/types may share one explicit module when no more precise owner exists. Appropriate contents include:

- `casesHandled`
- `shouldNeverHappen`
- `notYetImplemented`
- `Redacted`
- `Tags`, `ExtractTag`, and `ExcludeTag`
- common `Result` helpers when the project uses neither Effect nor `better-result`
- broad type utilities

Keep only helpers justified by the target project. Keep domain and application policy with their owning modules.

No arbitrary file-size limits. Prefer cohesion and discoverability over small files for their own sake. Split when a file has multiple unrelated reasons to change or callers must understand unrelated concepts.
